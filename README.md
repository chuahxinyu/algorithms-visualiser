## ✨ What it does

## 🛠 Tech Stack
* Frontend was built with [ReactJS]() and has the following dependencies:
  * `react`
  * `react-dom`
  * `react-scripts`
  * [`react-icons`]()
  * [`gh-pages`]() for deployment to github pages
  * [`react-grid-layout`]() for movement and resizing of cards
  * [`react-redux`]() for state management

## 🎯 Challenges I ran into
* found out that GitHub pages doesn't work with `react-router` so I had to create a custom routing solution (and learnt about hashed URLs on the way!)
* realised that having a state of an array of objects that is being constantly updated is a really bad idea

## 📖 What I learnt
* hashed vs unhashed URLS
* how to deploy stuff onto GitHub pages
